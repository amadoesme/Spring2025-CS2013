/**
 * Simple implementation of John Conway's Game of Life.
 * Starts with random seed and plays out on bounded grid
 * (without wrap-around).
 *
 *  User interactions:
 *    ENTER to evolve
 *    'A' to add a live cell
 *    'N' to display neighbor counts for each cell
 *    'Q' to end game

    Description: learned what John Conways game of life was.
    If a cell has more than 3 neighbors it dies because it is overcrowded.
    If it has less than 3 it does because of lonlyness. If it has 3 neighbors
    the cell gets to live. The cells regenerate and create shapes and patterns.
    Other comments: still need to do the bonus part of the prompt on canvas.
